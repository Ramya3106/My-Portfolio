# Vercel 404 Error - Complete Troubleshooting Guide

## **The Problem:**
You're getting a 404 "NOT FOUND" error on Vercel even after adding configuration files.

## **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Cached Deployment**: Vercel might be using cached configuration
2. **Wrong Configuration**: Multiple config files might conflict
3. **Build Issues**: The build might not be generating the correct files
4. **Routing Issues**: Vercel doesn't know how to handle client-side routing

## **Complete Solution Steps:**

### **Step 1: Clear Vercel Cache**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ General
4. Scroll down to "Build & Development Settings"
5. Click "Clear Build Cache"
6. Redeploy

### **Step 2: Use Vercel CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy from your project directory
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Link to existing project or create new
# - Set build command: npm run build
# - Set output directory: dist
# - Set install command: npm install
```

### **Step 3: Manual Configuration**
If CLI doesn't work, try these steps:

1. **Delete the current Vercel project**
2. **Create a new project** with these settings:
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

### **Step 4: Alternative Configuration Files**

I've created multiple configuration files to try:

1. **`vercel.json`** - Main configuration
2. **`now.json`** - Alternative configuration
3. **`public/_redirects`** - Fallback redirects

### **Step 5: Test the Build Locally**
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### **Step 6: Check Build Output**
Make sure your `dist` folder contains:
- `index.html`
- `assets/` folder with CSS and JS files

## **If Still Getting 404:**

### **Option A: Use Vercel's Auto-Detection**
1. Delete all config files (`vercel.json`, `now.json`)
2. Keep only `public/_redirects`
3. Let Vercel auto-detect it's a Vite project
4. Deploy

### **Option B: Manual Upload**
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Upload the `dist` folder directly to Vercel
3. Set the root directory to `dist`

### **Option C: Use a Different Platform**
If Vercel continues to have issues:
- **Netlify**: Often more reliable for React apps
- **Render**: Good alternative
- **GitHub Pages**: Free and simple

## **Verification Steps:**

1. **Check the API test**: Visit `your-domain.vercel.app/api/test`
   - Should return: `{"message": "API is working!"}`

2. **Check the main site**: Visit `your-domain.vercel.app`
   - Should show your portfolio

3. **Check build logs**: In Vercel dashboard, check if build succeeded

## **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: "Build Failed"**
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Ensure `npm run build` works locally
- Check Node.js version compatibility

### **Issue 2: "Assets Not Loading"**
- Check that `base: "/"` is set in `vite.config.js`
- Verify asset paths are relative
- Check if assets are in the `dist` folder

### **Issue 3: "Still 404 After All Config"**
- Try deploying to a different platform (Netlify)
- Check if your domain is configured correctly
- Verify the deployment URL

## **Final Checklist:**

- [ ] All config files are in the root directory
- [ ] `npm run build` works locally
- [ ] `dist` folder contains `index.html`
- [ ] Vercel cache is cleared
- [ ] Project is redeployed
- [ ] No conflicting configuration files

## **If Nothing Works:**

**Switch to Netlify** - It's often more reliable for React apps:

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Set publish directory: `dist`
5. Deploy

Your portfolio should work perfectly on Netlify!
